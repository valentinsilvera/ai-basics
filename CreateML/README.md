## About CreateML
Artificial Intelligence (AI) allows computer systems to think/act rationally/like a human. This includes planning future actions, optimizing results, reasoning, and learning from known or unknown data. This is the documentation of my first dip in the ever-expanding world of AI. I love food (I know, so original), so I decided to make a simple Image Classifier that works well on iOS devices to recognize and properly label different types of food.

## The Model

To make this project possible, I had to find a way to train a model that's small enough to work on a mobile application.
These are the three models I made. From the simplest to most complex (to train). Click on each one to see instructions and some of the key takeaways:
