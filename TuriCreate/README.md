## How to run

Open [Turi.ipynb](https://github.com/valentinsilvera/ai-basics/blob/main/TuriCreate/Turi.ipynb) to view the Jupyter Notebook

## About TuriCreate
Turi Create is an open-source python library developed by Apple, used to create core machine learning models for supervised and unsupervised learning. It includes the Vision Feature Extractor, as well as SqueezeNet v1.1 and Resnet-50 (too big for mobile apps at around 90MB per model)

## The Model

All the process of creating the model is in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/valentinsilvera/ai-basics/blob/main/TuriCreate/Turi.ipynb). Here's a representation of all the layers in the model, extracted using [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron)
